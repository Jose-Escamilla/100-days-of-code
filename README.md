# 🐍 100 Days of Code - Angela Yu's Python Course

This repository contains my daily progress throughout the 🔗[**"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"**](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?srsltid=AfmBOoqXNp44AZo_nD8_QYPr7c2X3pqRs4ibJuQM2gFKR36XMr9y_pvI&couponCode=ST21MT30625G2) course by Angela Yu (updated as of 2025).

Each folder (`Day1`, `Day2`, ..., `Day100`) represents a project or challenge developed during one day of the course.  
The goal is to document each project with its challenges, solutions, screenshots, and lessons learned.
